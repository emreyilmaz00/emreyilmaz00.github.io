Welcome to my personal website! I am a research scientist at German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology.

My research focuses on:
- data-driven aerodynamics
- multidisciplinary optimization for safe and autonomous flight
- flight dynamics and control

The specific applications include:
- wind tunnel and flight testing
- eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft 
- advanced air mobility

My research focuses on data-driven methodologies for aerodynamics applications. 

My research focuses on the origins of life, a fascinating field that seeks to understand how life arose from non-living matter. I am interested in the physical and chemical processes that may have led to the emergence of life, and how these processes can be studied experimentally. Through my work, I hope to contribute to our understanding of one of the most fundamental questions of science: what is life and how did it begin?
