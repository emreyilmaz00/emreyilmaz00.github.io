Welcome to my personal website! I am a research scientist at German Aerospace Center (DLR) - the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology.

My research focuses on:
- data-driven aerodynamic modeling
- multidisciplinary optimization for safe and autonomous flight
- flight dynamics

The specific applications include:
- wind tunnel and flight testing
- eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft 
- advanced air mobility

My research focuses on the origins of life, a fascinating field that seeks to understand how life arose from non-living matter. I am interested in the physical and chemical processes that may have led to the emergence of life, and how these processes can be studied experimentally. Through my work, I hope to contribute to our understanding of one of the most fundamental questions of science: what is life and how did it begin?

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
