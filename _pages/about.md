I am a Graduate Research Assistant Postdoctoral Fellow working in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech under the supervision of Prof. Wenke Lee. Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked in Center for Cyber Security at New York University Abu Dhabi as a Research Engineer for two years. I currently hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, an M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering and two B.Sc. degrees in both Computer Engineering and Electrical & Electronics Engineering from TOBB University, Turkey. My research interests span a broad range of topics including deep learning, applied cryptography, security/privacy and forensics.
