I conduct research about control, flight dynamic modeling, performance, and trajectory optimization of emerging electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft concepts. I also explore multi agent path planning optimization in the context of urban air mobility (UAM) and the application of emerging algorithms in deep learning to aerospace engineering problems. 


My research interests include:

    eVTOL Aircraft Research: 
        i)  Control Allocation and Trajectory Optimization 
       ii)  Flight Dynamic Modeling and Optimization
      iii)  The Implications of Over-Actuation on Flight Control, 
            Performance, and Design
       iv)  Contingency Planning 
       
       
    Physics Informed Machine Learning
       --The Application of Deep Learning Techniques (ConvNets and CGANs) to Airfoil Performance Prediction and Inverse Design
    
    UAM Air Traffic Optimization
    
    Automatic Flight Control Systems
    
    Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization


<!---I study the implications of new technologies such as electric propulsion and autonomy on the design of aircraft and on aviation markets. 

    Operations research and market studies for urban air mobility (UAM), on-demand mobility (ODM), and new modes of regional aviation

    Flight performance and sizing of electric aircraft

    Aerodynamics, performance, and design of distributed electric propulsion configurations

    Wind tunnel and flight tests of subscale CTOL, STOL, and VTOL aircraft


Brian German is the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) Langley Associate Professor in the School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech. His research involves aircraft electric propulsion, autonomous flight, and the emerging aviation markets that these technologies enable. 

He specializes in configuration design of electric aircraft, aerodynamics of distributed propulsion, battery and hybrid electric propulsion modeling, operations research problems for innovative scheduled and on-demand air services, and aircraft operational economics modeling. His work focuses primarily on new types of electric regional aircraft and eVTOL aircraft for urban air mobility. 

Prof. German is a founding member and former Chair (2014-2016) of the AIAA Transformational Flight Program Committee, which was chartered to explore the opportunities of emerging aircraft electric propulsion and autonomy technologies, and he is a member of the AIAA Aircraft Electric Propulsion and Power Working Group. Prof. German is a former Fulbright student scholar and NDSEG Graduate Research Fellow, and he received the NSF CAREER award in 2012. He is an Associate Fellow of AIAA Education. --->
