**Attitude Controller Design for a Quadrotor via Non-linear, Adaptive and Robust Control Techniques** 

We investigated adaptive, non-linear and robust control techniques to design an attitude controller for a quadrotor. The design and simulation of attitude controllers were carried out using non-linear dynamic inversion, model reference adaptive control (MRAC), MRAC with robustness modifications, and integral backstepping. Experiments were performed with an AscTech Hummingbird quadrotor.
