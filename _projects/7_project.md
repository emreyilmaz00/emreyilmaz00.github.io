**Attitude Controller Design for a Quadrotor Platform via Non-linear, Adapive and Robust Techniques** 

We investigated adaptive, non-linear and robust control techniques to design an attitude controller for a quadrotor platform. Design and simulation of attitude controllers were carred out using non-linear dynamic inversion, model reference adaptive control, robustness modifications, and integral backstepping. Experiments were performed with a quadrotor.
