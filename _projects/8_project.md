## Attitude Controller Design for a Quadrotor via Non-linear, Adaptive and Robust Control Techniques

We investigated adaptive, non-linear and robust control techniques to design an attitude controller for a quadrotor. The design and simulation of attitude controllers were carried out using non-linear dynamic inversion, model reference adaptive control (MRAC), MRAC with robustness modifications, and integral backstepping. Experiments were performed with an AscTech Hummingbird quadrotor.

## Wind Tunnel Data Measurement System Design and Tests
   
   Wind tunnel experiments were performed to measure force and moments exerted on a quadrotor platform for different flight scenarios. I participated in the design of measurement system using data acquisition and 6-DOF load cell unit with its substructures and in the integration of the system into the wind tunnel
