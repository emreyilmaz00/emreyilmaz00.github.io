**A Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Training Predictors for Airfoil Performance**
 - Medium-fidelity predictors were trained for predicting airfoil performance using deep convolutional neural networks. The framework was implemented in Tensorflow. 
 - Published a conference paper: <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2017-3660">AIAA Aviation'17</a> {% cite yilmaz17 %}.

**Conditional Generative Adversarial Network Framework for Airfoil Inverse Design**
 - A game theoretic framework was investigated by training conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) to generate airfoil shapes given the desired airfoil performance criteria.
