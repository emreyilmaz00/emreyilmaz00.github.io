**Advanced Air Mobility/UAM Air Traffic Optimization**: Multi-Agent Path Planning Optimization, Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, Model Predictive Control, Constraint Aggregation, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Optimal Control via Pseudospectral Methods 


UAM air traffic optimization using model predictive control and constraint aggregation. Solved dynamic obstacle avoidance problems. Used libraries: OpenMDAO, Dymos, SNOPT, IPOPT, SLSQP, Gurobi etc.
    \item ATM Path Planning in context of AAM using a Deep RL technique (\href{https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules}{MuZero Algorithm})
    \item Investigation of Air Traffic Metrics, Creating Optimal Highway Corridors Using Multi-Commodity Flow and MILP
    \item Contributed to \href{https://olasanni1.github.io/ETOL/index.html}{Extensible Trajectory Optimization Library (ETOL)} for Dymos integration
    \item Published two AIAA conference papers: \href{https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2021-2377}{[AIAA'21a]}, \href{https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2021-2376}{[AIAA'21b]}. Submitted a journal paper to \href{https://arc.aiaa.org/journal/jat}{[AIAA JAT]}.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<!---
{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} --->
