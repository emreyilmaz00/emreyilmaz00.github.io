AAM/UAM air traffic management problems were formulated and solved via various optimization approaches. 

## Model Predictive Control Approach

We solved high-capacity urban air traffic optimization problems using model predictive control with constraint aggregation techniques. In a multi-agent environment, agent trajectories were optimized based on origin-destination pairs for the following optimization paradigms: 
  - Centralized optimization at each time step 
  - Sequential optimization at each time step
  - Sequential optimization for the entire flight trajectory

## Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach

  Inspired by the success of DeepMindâ€™s deep reinforcement learning algorithm, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">MuZero</a>, in mastering games without any knowledge about the rules and the environment, we investigated the feasibility of using MuZero for AAM research by casting the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem as a game.

## Mixed Integer Linear Programming 

In this project led by Kotwicz Herniczek, corridor design problem were formulated as a minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem. The goal is to generate a corridor network that is globally optimum in terms of trip length, airspace complexity, and corridor network size using linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems and Gurobi.

## Pseudospectral Methods

Pseudospectral methods were explored to achieve minimum time multi agent paths using using OpenMDAO, Dymos, and SNOPT.
