   - The prior information at the basic event levels can vary notably in fault trees.
   - An approach for uncertainty propagation via statistical moments is developed.
   - The approach depends on the distribution types when dependencies exist.
   - Sensitivity analysis is leveraged for optimizing resource allocations.
   - Constrained optimization problems are formulated to improve system safety.
   - The optimization problem is solved using augmented Lagrangian approach.
