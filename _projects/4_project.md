To improve the reliability of aerospace systems considering the uncertainty propagation, a fault tree analysis based formulation is structured. Safety analysis of aerospace vehicle subsystems were performed by propagating statistical moments in fault trees. A resource allocation optimization problem is formulated to improve the top level event. The optimization problem is solved using augmented Lagrangian approach.
