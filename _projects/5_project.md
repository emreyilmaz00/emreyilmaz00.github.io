 UAM Landing Surface Design with Considerations about Energy, Power, and Constraints including Vortex Ring States, Dead Man's Diagram, Acceleration and Obstacle Limits, Influence of Turbulence to Landing Accuracy, Circular Error Probables  
 
 - Landing Approach Surfaces Design and Performance Analysis in terms of Energy, Power, and Time. 
 - Constraint analysis considering inflow modeling, VRS, acceleration limits, dead man's curve, speed limits, obstacles, and FAA regulations. 
 - Landing Simulations under Turbulence Using Retrofit Tilt-Wing Model and Landing Accuracy Analysis via Circular Error Probables.
