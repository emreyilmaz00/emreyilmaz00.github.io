**Introduction**

With the introduction of novel eVTOL aircraft, the complexity in aircraft design and air space management will drastically increase. Safety and efficiency concerns must be solved before successful commercial flight operations can begin. In my research related to eVTOL aircraft, the objective is to respond to these concerns by formulating and solving optimization problems that will help enabling these technologies.  

Specifically, I focus on the following subjects:
  - eVTOL Aircraft Flight Dynamics and Performance Modeling
  - Control Allocation Optimization for Over-Actuated eVTOL Aircraft
  - Hybrid Automaton-Based Planning
  - Distributed Electric Propulsion Concepts
  - Transition Corridors and Tilting Schedule Considerations
  - Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization Frameworks

**Flight Dynamics Modeling of Over-Actuated Tandem Tilt-Wing Distributed Propulsion eVTOL Aircraft**
The flight dynamics model of an over-actuated tandem tilt-wing distributed propulsion eVTOL aircraft was created using surrogate modeling. VSPAERO's unsteady Vortex Lattice Method based flow solver was used to generate data. Computational experiments were conducted according to a design of experiments (DoE) approach.
