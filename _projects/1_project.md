With the introduction of novel eVTOL aircraft, the complexity in aircraft design and air space management will drastically increase. Safety and efficiency concerns must be solved before successful commercial flight operations can begin. In my research related to eVTOL aircraft, our objective is to refer to these concerns by formulating and solving problems and enabling these technologies.  

Specifically, I focus on the following subjects in this research direction:
  - Hybrid Automaton-Based Path Planning
  - Control Allocation Optimization
  - Over-Actuated eVTOL Aircraft Flight Dynamic and Performance Modeling
  - Distributed Propulsion Concepts
  - Transition/Tilting Considerations
  - Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization Frameworks 


**Control Allocation Optimization**

<!---You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.--->

**Hybrid Automata Based Planning**

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/evtol2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/evtol3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<!---The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:--->

<!--- {% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} --->


<!---Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width. To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:--->

   <!---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
