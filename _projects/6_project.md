 - Landing approach surfaces design and performance analysis in terms of energy, power, and time 
 - Constraint analysis considering inflow modeling, vortex ring state (VRS), acceleration limits, h-V (dead man's) diagram, speed limits, obstacles, and FAA regulations
 - Landing simulations under turbulence using retrofitted tilt-wing flight dynamic models and landing accuracy analysis via circular error probables
 - Published a conference paper. {% cite yilmaz19 %}
